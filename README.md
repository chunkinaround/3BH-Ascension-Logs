Ascension logs for KoL

This is just a way for me to keep all my ascension logs visible and easy to share with people. These should not be viewed as optimal runs, Im mostly posting because there arent many logs of old challenge paths.

Current logs here are:

## 1-skill 2/459 AWOL SC Beanslinger
Some commentary on this run. I accidentally took snake-whip as my snake oiler skill instead of anything else. Also, it took 23 cornucopias to get 24 stuffing fluffers to end the war, which is worse rng than ezandora's calculator lets on. I also got beaten up by every monster I duplicated which was a nice bit of humble pie.

## 3/425 SC Class Act 2 DB

## 0-skill 3/386 SC Jarlsberg
In actuality this was a 5 day run, but I didnt play days 3 or 4 because I was at a wedding.

## 30-Skill 4/684 HC Boris
I didnt actually play any turns day 1 because I ascended too close to rollover and also spent time hunting factoids day 4 in the tower.
